# File Browser
## About
A file browser is a file browser made using Node.JS.

## How to use
Install node.js (Linux)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Clone and start the program
```
git clone https://github.com/cappe987/filebrowser.git
cd filebrowser
node server.js

The server is now accessible through the URL `localhost:3000`. The browser will now let you freely browse through your files, starting from the directory specified in the `rootdir` constant in server.js.
